    "Based loosely on Wang, et. al.’s paper on Plan-and-Solve Prompting, and Yohei Nakajima’s BabyAGI project, this simple architecture is emblematic of the planning agent architecture. It consists of two basic components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) A planner, which prompts an LLM to generate a multi-step plan to complete a large task.\n",
    "2) Executor(s), which accept the user query and a step in the plan and invoke 1 or more tools to complete that task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once execution is completed, the agent is called again with a re-planning prompt, letting it decide whether to finish with a response or whether to generate a follow-up plan (if the first plan didn’t have the desired effect).\n",
    "\n",
    "This agent design lets us avoid having to call the large planner LLM for each tool invocation. It still is restricted by serial tool calling and uses an LLM for each task since it doesn't support variable assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 2 patterns that extends the plan-and-execute pattern:\n",
    "- Reasoning Without Observation (ReWOO) (Can execute multiple tasks without replaning)\n",
    "- LLM Compiler (Improve speed of task execution)\n",

    "E2: LLM[Quarterback for the first team of #E1]\n",

    "The planner can reference previous outputs using syntax like #E2 . This means it can execute a task list without having to re-plan every time.\n",

    "##### LLM Compiler\n",
    "\n",
    "The LLMCompiler has the following main components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Planner: streams a DAG of tasks. Each task contains a tool, arguments, and list of dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Task Fetching Unit schedules and executes the tasks. This accepts a stream of tasks. This unit schedules tasks once their dependencies are met. Since many tools involve other calls to search engines or LLMs, the extra parallelism can grant a significant speed boost (the paper claims 3.6x).\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Joiner: dynamically replan or finish based on the entire graph history (including task execution results) is an LLM step that decides whether to respond with the final answer or whether to pass the progress back to the (re-)planning agent to continue work.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key runtime-boosting ideas here are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Planner outputs are streamed; the output parser eagerly yields task parameters and their dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The task fetching unit receives the parsed task stream and schedules tasks once all their dependencies are satisfied.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Task arguments can be variables, which are the outputs of previous tasks in the DAG. For instance, the model can call search(\"${1}\") to search for queries generated by the output of task 1. This lets the agent work even faster than the \"embarrassingly parallel\" tool calling in OpenAI."

The average lifespan for his species in captivity is stated to be 40-60 years, so Cookie lived around 23-43 years longer than the typical lifespan for that type of cockatoo. For monk parakeets, a common parrot species, the average lifespan in the wild is about 6 years, but in captivity they can reach 10-20 years. So Cookie the cockatoo was an exceptionally long-lived parrot, significantly exceeding the average for his species.\n"

The prime minister advises the sovereign on the exercise of much of the royal prerogative, chairs the Cabinet, and selects its ministers. As modern prime ministers hold office by virtue of their ability to command the confidence of the House of Commons, they sit as members of Parliament.\\nThe office of prime minister is not established by any statute or constitutional document, but exists only by long-established convention, whereby the monarch appoints as prime minister the person most likely to command the confidence of the House of Commons. In practice, this is the leader of the political party that holds the largest number of seats in the Commons. The prime minister is ex officio also First Lord of the Treasury (prior to 1905 also the official title of the position), Minister for the Civil Service, the minister responsible for national security,: p.22  and Minister for the Union. The prime minister's official residence and office, by virtue of being the First Lord of the Treasury, is 10 Downing Street in London.\\nEarly conceptions of the office of prime minister evolved as the \\\"Primus inter pares\\\" or \\\"first among equals\\\", however that does not differentiate on status and responsibility upon whoever is holding office. Historically, the prime minister has never been the first among equals at any time prior to 1868. Until now, that characterisation of the prime minister is reflective of the democratic nature of their position. The power of the prime minister depends on the support of their respective party and on the popular mandate. The appointment of cabinet ministers and granting of honours are done through the prime minister's power of appointment. The prime minister alongside the cabinet proposes new legislation and decide on key policies that fit their agenda which is then passed by an act of parliament.\\nThe power of the office of prime minister has grown significantly since the first prime minister, Robert Walpole in 1721. Prime ministerial power itself evolved gradually alongside the office itself which have played an increasingly prominent role in British politics since the early 20th century. During the premierships of Tony Blair and Margaret Thatcher, prime ministerial power expanded substantially and their leadership in the office were described as \\\"presidential\\\" due to their personal yielding of power and tight control over the cabinet. The prime minister is regarded as one of the world's most powerful political leaders in modern times. As the leader of the world's sixth largest economy, the prime minister hold significant domestic and international leadership alongside being the leader of a prominent member state of NATO, the G7 and G20.\\n58 people (55 men and 3 women) have served as prime minister, the first of whom was Robert Walpole taking office on 3 April 1721. The longest-serving prime minister was also Walpole, who served over 20 years, and the shortest-serving was Liz Truss, who served seven weeks. The current prime minister is Keir Starmer, who succeeded Rishi Sunak on 5 July 2024, following the 2024 general election.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\nThe position of prime minister was not created but evolved slowly and organically over three hundred years due to numerous Acts of Parliament, political developments, and accidents of history. \\nAfter a series of bills passed by the House of Commons, such as the Bill of Rights in 1689, the powers of the monarch were reduced, being replaced by the powers of parliament. \\nThe head of Treasury, as Lord Treasurer, was give the power in 1706 following Standing Order Number 66 to draft money bills (budgets) instead of MPs outside of government. The informal term of 'Prime Minister' was first recorded around that time, which since 1721 had mostly also been the office holder for the First Lord of the Treasury. \\nSir Robert Walpole was the first Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, though his predecessors as First Lord of the Treasury also held a similar position. \\nThe role of Prime Minister grew more distinct as the head of government and often more recognisable within the public than other members of the cabinet, which demonstrates the increasing power of the Prime Minister in modern times than that originally created. \\n\\n\\n== Powers and authority ==\\n\\n\\n=== Executive powers ===\\nThe prime minister is the head of the United Kingdom government. As such, the modern prime minister leads the Cabinet (the Executive). In addition, the prime minister leads a major political party and generally commands a majority in the House of Commons (the lower chamber of Parliament). The incumbent wields both significant legislative and executive powers. Under the British system, there is a unity of powers rather than separation. Walter Bagehot described the office of prime minister as the \\\"keystone of the Cabinet arch\\\" that maintained while the prime minister can hold significant power over the executive, it is often exercised collectively through the Cabinet (Government).\\nMinisterial responsibility is also an aspect of a prime minister's executive authority. The prime minister leads the cabinet which makes the holder of that office bear responsibility for the collective conduct of the government. Professor Rodney Brazier points out that the since the prime minister wields significant sway over policy, that power must be subjected to the conclusion and input of Cabinet ministers. This prevents the office of prime minister from becoming more dominant and also ensures that executive power is authorised with broader support from and within the government. The prime minister must constantly maintain the confidence of the House of Commons because, as Bagehot notes, the power of the prime minister derives from their ability to command a majority in the House in order to pass legislation and continue the functions of government. If a prime minister loses the confidence of the House, which occurs in a vote of no confidence, they are often expected to resign from office or request the monarch dissolve parliament to call a general election.\\n\\nThe prime minister acts as the principal advisor to the monarch, who is the head of state, a capacity that has evolved gradually during the history of the office. Bagehot says that despite the monarch holding certain theoretical executive powers, in practice, these powers are often executed upon the advice and recommendation of the prime minister and the cabinet. This is considered a major principle of the \\\"unity of powers\\\" that exists within a constitutional monarchy in which the monarch \\\"reigns but does not rule\\\". According to Brazier, the prime minister advises the monarch on matters such as the dissolution of parliament and appointments to the House of Lords, but these decisions are often made with the consent of parliament.\\nThe prime minister leads the executive in directing government policy and maintaining coordination between government departments which is dependent upon the cooperation and consent of ministers. Foreign policy and national security are areas in which the prime minister has traditionally enjoyed more authority under what are known as prerogative powers. Vernon Bogdanor argues that the abilities to declare war, negotiate treaties and deploy the armed forces have historically been part of the monarch's royal authority but have slowly evolved into a function of the office of prime minister. Despite this, the exercise of the prime minister's prerogative powers in these matters is under the oversight of parliament. It is often by convention that a prime minister must seek the approval of parliament before committing the nation to military action. In addition to this, the prime minister also exerts informal influence over public policy. Brazier notes this is due to the prime minister often being the leader of the largest party in government, therefore having a direct impact in initiating policy both in government and during election campaigns.\\n\\n\\n=== Legislative powers ===\\nIn the House of Commons, the prime minister guides the law-making process with the goal of enacting the legislative agenda of their political party. In an executive capacity, the prime minister appoints (and may dismiss) all other Cabinet members and ministers, and co-ordinates the policies and activities of all government departments, and the staff of the Civil Service. The prime minister also acts as the public \\\"face\\\" and \\\"voice\\\" of His Majesty's Government, both at home and abroad. Solely upon the advice of the prime minister, the sovereign exercises many statutory and prerogative powers, including high judicial, political, official and Church of England ecclesiastical appointments; the conferral of peerages and some knighthoods, decorations and other important honours.\\n\\nBagehot identifies the prime minister as the leader of the \\\"efficient\\\" part of government that functions within the government to steer legislation through both Houses of Parliament. Although the prime minister does not possess the power to introduce legislation directly, their control of the cabinet and their role as leader of the largest political party in the House of Commons enables them substantial influence over any legislative agenda. Bagehot points out that this power is based on the prime minister's ability to operate the \\\"machinery of government\\\" that allows them to guide legislation that align with their party's political and ideological priorities. Brazier argues that the legislative power of the prime minister has greatly expanded following the post-war period and that as a result, the prime minister now directly authorises supervision over government bills and has a consequential role in the introduction of legislation.\\nThe prime minister is able to wield considerable power in the passing of legislation through their ability to manage party discipline and cohesion in voting patterns. Bogdanor states that this largely depends upon the prime minister being the leader of the largest party in the Commons, which can pass legislation without any or little resistance if they can command the confidence of the House. This aspect of prime ministerial power is informal and often carried out by the office of Whips, who makes sure that MPs remain loyal and vote on the government line. The political scientist Anthony King said that the prime minister's influence over legislation is further solidified through their ability to shape policy before it reaches parliament. King further argued that the shaping of legislation, on many occasions, involves the collaborative efforts of cabinet ministers and civil servants, but the prime minister's approval is needed in order to initiate the legislative agenda. King's analysis of contemporary politcs showed that some prime ministers often bypass or overrule the cabinet on traditional discussion and to push through their preferred agendas with notable cases such as Margaret Thatcher and Tony Blair.\\n\\n\\n=== Parliamentary powers ===\\n\\nThe prime minister's influence in the Houses of Parliament is derived from longstanding conventions and statutes that have gradually evolved through the centuries. The office of prime minister itself is not explicitly mentioned in parliamentary law but is developed by constitutional conventions and therefore it is defined by precedent and tradition. Bogdanor notes that the prime minister's power in parliament is exhibited by their control of the executive (the Cabinet) and their ability to influence the legislative agenda. The ability of the prime minister to influence legislation, according to academic Philip Norton, is often through party discipline and having a reliable majority of MPs who vote in support of the government's priorities.\\nAnother essential part of the parliamentary powers possessed by the prime minister is determining the composition of the Cabinet.

Walter Bagehot described the office of prime minister as the \\\"keystone of the Cabinet arch\\\" that maintained while the prime minister can hold significant power over the executive, it is often exercised collectively through the Cabinet (Government).\\\\nMinisterial responsibility is also an aspect of a prime minister\\\\'s executive authority. The prime minister leads the cabinet which makes the holder of that office bear responsibility for the collective conduct of the government. Professor Rodney Brazier points out that the since the prime minister wields significant sway over policy, that power must be subjected to the conclusion and input of Cabinet ministers. This prevents the office of prime minister from becoming more dominant and also ensures that executive power is authorised with broader support from and within the government. The prime minister must constantly maintain the confidence of the House of Commons because, as Bagehot notes, the power of the prime minister derives from their ability to command a majority in the House in order to pass legislation and continue the functions of government. If a prime minister loses the confidence of the House, which occurs in a vote of no confidence, they are often expected to resign from office or request the monarch dissolve parliament to call a general election.\\\\n\\\\nThe prime minister acts as the principal advisor to the monarch, who is the head of state, a capacity that has evolved gradually during the history of the office. Bagehot says that despite the monarch holding certain theoretical executive powers, in practice, these powers are often executed upon the advice and recommendation of the prime minister and the cabinet. This is considered a major principle of the \\\"unity of powers\\\" that exists within a constitutional monarchy in which the monarch \\\"reigns but does not rule\\\". According to Brazier, the prime minister advises the monarch on matters such as the dissolution of parliament and appointments to the House of Lords, but these decisions are often made with the consent of parliament.\\\\nThe prime minister leads the executive in directing government policy and maintaining coordination between government departments which is dependent upon the cooperation and consent of ministers. Foreign policy and national security are areas in which the prime minister has traditionally enjoyed more authority under what are known as prerogative powers. Vernon Bogdanor argues that the abilities to declare war, negotiate treaties and deploy the armed forces have historically been part of the monarch\\\\'s royal authority but have slowly evolved into a function of the office of prime minister. Despite this, the exercise of the prime minister\\\\'s prerogative powers in these matters is under the oversight of parliament. It is often by convention that a prime minister must seek the approval of parliament before committing the nation to military action. In addition to this, the prime minister also exerts informal influence over public policy. Brazier notes this is due to the prime minister often being the leader of the largest party in government, therefore having a direct impact in initiating policy both in government and during election campaigns.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n=== Legislative powers ===\\\\nIn the House of Commons, the prime minister guides the law-making process with the goal of enacting the legislative agenda of their political party. In an executive capacity, the prime minister appoints (and may dismiss) all other Cabinet members and ministers, and co-ordinates the policies and activities of all government departments, and the staff of the Civil Service. The prime minister also acts as the public \\\"face\\\" and \\\"voice\\\" of His Majesty\\\\'s Government, both at home and abroad. Solely upon the advice of the prime minister, the sovereign exercises many statutory and prerogative powers, including high judicial, political, official and Church of England ecclesiastical appointments; the conferral of peerages and some knighthoods, decorations and other important honours.\\\\n\\\\nBagehot identifies the prime minister as the leader of the \\\"efficient\\\" part of government that functions within the government to steer legislation through both Houses of Parliament. Although the prime minister does not possess the power to introduce legislation directly, their control of the cabinet and their role as leader of the largest political party in the House of Commons enables them substantial influence over any legislative agenda. Bagehot points out that this power is based on the prime minister\\\\'s ability to operate the \\\"machinery of government\\\" that allows them to guide legislation that align with their party\\\\'s political and ideological priorities. Brazier argues that the legislative power of the prime minister has greatly expanded following the post-war period and that as a result, the prime minister now directly authorises supervision over government bills and has a consequential role in the introduction of legislation.\\\\nThe prime minister is able to wield considerable power in the passing of legislation through their ability to manage party discipline and cohesion in voting patterns. Bogdanor states that this largely depends upon the prime minister being the leader of the largest party in the Commons, which can pass legislation without any or little resistance if they can command the confidence of the House. This aspect of prime ministerial power is informal and often carried out by the office of Whips, who makes sure that MPs remain loyal and vote on the government line. The political scientist Anthony King said that the prime minister\\\\'s influence over legislation is further solidified through their ability to shape policy before it reaches parliament. King further argued that the shaping of legislation, on many occasions, involves the collaborative efforts of cabinet ministers and civil servants, but the prime minister\\\\'s approval is needed in order to initiate the legislative agenda. King\\\\'s analysis of contemporary politcs showed that some prime ministers often bypass or overrule the cabinet on traditional discussion and to push through their preferred agendas with notable cases such as Margaret Thatcher and Tony Blair.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n=== Parliamentary powers ===\\\\n\\\\nThe prime minister\\\\'s influence in the Houses of Parliament is derived from longstanding conventions and statutes that have gradually evolved through the centuries. The office of prime minister itself is not explicitly mentioned in parliamentary law but is developed by constitutional conventions and therefore it is defined by precedent and tradition. Bogdanor notes that the prime minister\\\\'s power in parliament is exhibited by their control of the executive (the Cabinet) and their ability to influence the legislative agenda. The ability of the prime minister to influence legislation, according to academic Philip Norton, is often through party discipline and having a reliable majority of MPs who vote in support of the government\\\\'s priorities.\\\\nAnother essential part of the parliamentary powers possessed by the prime minister is determining the composition of the Cabinet.
